## shred.py - shred a given image into columns of equal width strips.
##
##            Takes some effort to ensure that adjacent strips don't
##            end up next to each other.
##
## Usage:
##
##    ./shred.py source destination [strip_width=32]
##
##    source - the input file.  Must exist.
##    destination - the destination file.  Will be created or
##                  overwritten if exists.
##
##    strip_width - the width of each column.  Taken as 32 if not
##                  provided.
##
##                  It is the users responsibility to ensure that the
##                  source.size.width is a multiple of strip_width.
